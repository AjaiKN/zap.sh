zap.sh \- manual page for zap.sh 0.0.10
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zap
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... [\fI\,--\/\fR] \fI\,FILE\/\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Put each FILE in the trash. Currently supports macOS and Linux.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this usage message.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Override non\-writable files, and ignore nonexistent or otherwise untrashable files.
If any of the files are owned by the current user but don't have write permissions,
delete them anyway. If any of the files are nonexistent, or if we can't trash them
(because their directories aren't writable and executable), ignore them and still
trash everything else. (Otherwise, this command will refuse to do anything if any
of the arguments are untrashable.)
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Don't actually trash anything; just print what this command *would* do.
This option implies \fB\-\-verbose\fR.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-strategy\fR=\fI\,STRATEGY\/\fR
Specify which trashing strategy to use.
Can also be specified with the ZAP_STRATEGY environment variable, which this
option supersedes.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dir\fR
Does nothing. For compatibility with rm.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
Does nothing. For compatibility with rm.
